    "text": "The Arizona Cardinals have selected Michigan defensive back Will Johnson with the 47th overall pick during Friday's draft. Wow, well this could end up being a steal for the Cardinals as Johnson fell in the draft likely due to injury concerns. Johnson was viewed as a Day 1 prospect, but being limited to seven games last season probably hurt his draft stock. When healthy, Johnson has proven to be an elite zone coverage defensive back with good size and length. He finished his college career with 57 tackles, nine interceptions, and three returned touchdowns. Johnson should be a Day 1 starter and an immediate impact player on defense in Arizona."

It was tough sledding for Murray and the Cardinals offense in Seattle a week ago. The Cardinals failed to produce a touchdown, and Murray threw a momentum-shifting pick-six that set the Cardinals' comeback hopes back by a large margin. However, the Cardinals' offense should return to its usual form this week. The Vikings' stout defense presents a challenge for the Cardinals' passing attack, but this is a unit that has earned its trust. The matchup makes Murray a low-end QB start, but he should still be started in Week 14."

He's not quite on the IDP radar just yet, but Wilson is one to keep an eye on after an impressive rookie season. Hopefully his injury in training camp isn't a serious one."

Browning is underrated because of his size (6-foot-3, 240 pounds), but he has prototypical size to play the Mike linebacker position as a run-stopping force. He also has enough mobility to drop into zone coverage, which will give defensive-minded head coach Vic Fangio some intriguing possibilities to confuse the opposing offense. His size could also make him an option for covering tight ends. Browning's advanced technique and awareness of the game give him the necessary intangibles. Can be hurt by his aggressiveness, but over time, Browning could become an excellent all-around linebacker."

The Cardinals' offense has struggled to establish a run game, especially after their poor performance against the Seahawks in Week 13, where Conner was limited to just eight yards on seven carries. However, Conner's five targets in the passing game show that the team is still committed to keeping him involved in their offense. Even with the difficult matchup, Conner's steady involvement in the passing game gives him a solid floor for fantasy points, especially in PPR formats. The Vikings' defense has been relatively middle-of-the-pack against the run, so while Conner may not have a high ceiling this week, he can still provide decent fantasy value as a low-end RB2. The key for Conner is his volume, and barring a drastic change in game script, he should see enough touches to justify a start in most lineups."

Mayo has praised Maye's commitment and progress since joining the team. The upcoming preseason finale against the Commanders will be crucial for the coaching staff to evaluate the quarterbacks in a game-like scenario. Regardless of who secures the starting role, neither quarterback is expected to have a significant fantasy impact."

The Patriots are looking to bounce back against the New Orleans Saints, and while they could absolutely do so, that doesn't guarantee success for Ryland. The rookie kicker is 5-for-5 on extra points but just 4-for-7 on field goals this year. That line includes a 2-for-4 performance from the Patriots' lone win over the Jets in Week 3. Even as the bye week impacts rosters, fantasy managers can find more reliable options at kicker for Week 5."

Deguara is a red-zone threat, as he had 12 total touchdowns over his final two years in college. He should see the field plenty as a rookie because of his great athleticism, but he'll be battling Jace Sternberger and Robert Tonyan. Cincinnati used him all over the field, including as an H-back, so expect head coach Matt LaFleur to get creative in using Deguara."

He is playing on fourth down right now, so he is learning all that. He's eager to learn. He doesn't make mistakes twice and he's got juice. He's physical, just like all those guys. Long way to go. But I like where he is at.\" The 23-year-old has also taken on the responsibility of wearing the green dot, which has added to the steep learning curve heading into his first year in the NFL. The Ohio State product was plenty productive on college for the Buckeyes, but even though he's flashed during the offseason program, he might have to wait for a full-time role in Arizona."

Robinson weighed in at 285 pounds and has long arms and plenty of power to push his way to opposing quarterbacks. He's also serviceable in the run game and will compete for plenty of playing time right away in the desert in 2024 next to Zaven Collins and BJ Ojulari.

He's seen by teams as the most pro-ready tackle, and he also has considerable upside given his inexperience at the position. Northwestern's Peter Skoronski is believed to be an offensive guard at the next level. Johnson is considered the cleanest tackle and could be off the board early in the first round. If the Arizona Cardinals are able to trade out of the No. 3 spot and move down, they could target Johnson."

The undrafted rookie reached that mark on just two catches on four targets. Weaver gained 43 yards on his first reception of that game, tumbling to the ground in order to reel in the deep pass. The Colorado product also handled two kickoffs and two punt returns for a total of 81 yards. In the wake of Zay Jones's recent suspension, Weaver may have an easier time making the final roster on Tuesday. Managers in leagues that count return yards might want to keep an eye on how the Cardinals use Weaver should he make the team, otherwise he can be ignored in fantasy drafts."

The 25-year-old posted a career-high 51 tackles (26 solo), five tackles for loss, nine QB hits, three sacks and two fumble recoveries in 17 games (15 starts) in 2021. Nichols should help the Raiders in both run and pass defense, although his biggest contributions should come in run defense for a Raiders team that struggled in that area last year."

It was just the fourth time in ten games that the 23-year-old was held out of the end zone, but it was the fourth time this season that he's garnered double-digit targets and the seventh game with six or more receptions, making him one of the more reliable wideouts for fantasy. The former first-round draft pick is top 10 in the league in targets (82) and receptions (58) through ten weeks, but it will be tough sledding next week in Denver as the Falcons will face a stout Broncos pass defense.

The 36-year-old is also due a $10 million roster cut on March 17, so if he's not traded, Atlanta is expected to cut him before then. Cousins was benched for Penix in Week 16 and ended up being a bust after signing a four-year, $180 million deal last offseason. The four-time Pro Bowler threw for 3,508 yards, 18 touchdowns and a league-high 16 interceptions in his 14 starts."

The backup running back is highly efficient, averaging 6.15 yards per carry, and had proven his ability to be a solid lead back through the last four games of 2022 before lead back Bijan Robinson (hamstring) was drafted. The Bucs have struggled to stop the run this year, too. Robinson has struggled so far, and Allgeier's runs have been much more successful on average. He shouldn't be started yet, but he is a must-have handcuff for Bijan managers and a fine speculative bench stash. Should Tyler's role continue to grow, he could be start-worthy at some point."

The team also took linebacker Jalon Walker at 15th overall. Pearce was originally a potential top-five draft pick before he underwhelmed a bit in his senior season at Tennessee with 7.5 sacks. His size is a question mark for an outside edge rusher, but Pearce's athleticism isn't in question. The Falcons are hoping their selections of both Pearce and Walker pay off immediately and boost their pass rush in 2025."

Washington racked up just 1,508 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns in 55 collegiate games, but Atlanta clearly liked something they saw on tape, and his performance in practice is all that matters from this point on.

    "text": "Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is fresh off of a humongous performance against the New York Giants in Week 15 where he threw five touchdowns. In Week 16, however, the Pittsburgh Steelers present a bigger challenge. The only week that Jackson finished outside QB1 territory this season was against the Steelers in Week 11. He averages one fumble and a bit over one interception (1.1) per game in seven starts against the Steelers to go along with 153.9 passing yards on a 56.97% completion percentage. While this doesn't mean fantasy managers should bench Jackson by any means, expectations shouldn't be as high as the rest of the year."

Hopkins was third on the team with five targets in this contest. The Chiefs narrowly escaped with the victory on a game-sealing blocked field goal by Kansas City. Hopkins did not produce as he did against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last week, but he was still the undisputed WR1 for the Kansas City passing attack. Hopkins will look to produce in Week 11 against the Buffalo Bills, who rank sixth in fantasy points allowed to opposing wide receivers this season. It will be a tough matchup for the veteran receiver, but he's talented enough to produce with Patrick Mahomes throwing him the ball. Fantasy managers should view Hopkins as a low-end WR2 heading into a tough matchup against the Bills."

Hamilton finished with 41 tackles, 10 passes defensed and four interceptions while earning freshman All-American honors in his first collegiate season. Not only can he cover tons of ground, but he is a strong tackler in the open field and can cover both tight ends and running backs, which will give the Ravens plenty of options on D. Hamilton is considered one of the best safety prospects in the last five years."

Rush did throw for over 300 yards with a touchdown and interception in the loss to Houston on Monday, but there's a good chance Lance could be making starts under center for the Cowboys by season's end now that Dak Prescott (hamstring) is out for the year. Rush will be no better than a low-end QB2 in superflex leagues this Sunday against Washington."

With Marquise Brown also on the roster and this team focusing a lot on the running game and on throwing to tight ends, it's hard to see much room for Wallace to breakout in his first NFL season. He led the Cowboys in receiving in each of his three seasons as a starter and is a great route runner who can make plays despite not being the fastest guy in the world. If healthy, he'll have a role in Baltimore for years, but it's impossible to love this landing spot with everything we know about the Ravens offense."

Even though Saquon Barkley is the current rushing leader after Thursday night, Henry has two more touchdowns, a higher yards per attempt average, and sits at RB1 on the season. In Week 11, he'll go up against the Pittsburgh Steelers who give up an average of 19.0 fantasy points per game to opposing backfields in half-PPR formats. They've allowed the fourth-fewest rushing yards in the league and only seven rushing touchdowns all season. Henry still boasts RB1 potential, however, because the Steelers are more stout against the passing game, so the game plan will likely go through the backfield."

He doesn't play much near the line of scrimmage, but Starks should be a starter for the Ravens sooner than later. Starks has played much better in zone defense than when he's asked to cover receivers in man-to-man coverage."

Despite being listed as a second-string defensive back, the TCU product logged nearly 65% of Baltimore's defensive snaps in 2024.

The 23-year-old Loop impressed the coaching staff during offseason workouts after making 83.6% of his field goals in his four seasons with the Wildcats in college. Loop could be a bit inconsistent in his rookie season if he wins the job, but given the offense he's in, he could be fantasy relevant immediately."

Jones' injury doesn't appear to be all that serious, but the Ravens are going to play it safe with the LSU product during offseason workouts before training camp begins. When the 21-year-old offensive lineman is fully healthy and returns to practice, he's expected to mix in at right guard for the Ravens. Depending on how things shake out, he could also be a backup option at right tackle behind Roger Rosengarten. Expect Jones to enter his rookie season in the NFL as a reserve offensive lineman."

The 23-year-old started 36 games over five seasons at North Carolina, but he never recorded more than 34 tackles or 8.5 sacks in a single campaign. However, he got to the quarterback six times in 2024 in only eight contests and seemed well on his way to setting a career best in the metric before a broken fibula ended his season early. Rucker has the length and athleticism to make plays off the edge, but his smaller stature makes him liable to be pushed around at the point of attack. Still, he could do well as a rotational pass-rusher on the Ravens' defensive front. The former Tar Heel will join a unit that ranked second in the league last year in total sacks (54)."

The 22-year-old was easily the best center in this year's class, but his shorter arms and smaller size (296 pounds), so he's unlikely to move to a guard spot down the road in the NFL. He'll help fill a position that the Ravens struggled with in 2021, so Linderbaum should be hiking the ball to quarterback Lamar Jackson right away in his first season. Linderbaum was a two-time All-American at Iowa in college."

At 6-foot-6, 335 pounds, Cleveland has the size and strength to be a Week 1 starter in his rookie season if the Ravens choose to go that route. In a run-first offense, Baltimore will surely rely on his pure strength and physicality on the offensive line. He can be stiff with his lateral movement, but Cleveland has good hands and fits nicely with the Ravens physical style of play."

Ismail also noted that Wester \"hasn't looked overwhelmed by anything thrown at him.\" The 23-year-old broke out during his final season with Florida Atlantic in 2023 (108/1,168/8) but took a slight step back upon his transfer to Colorado in 2024. Baltimore's pass-catching corps isn't one that projects to have much vacant playing time, but the rookie seems bound for at least a role on special teams.

The Bills have been in talks with Poyer's agents, Drew Rosenhaus and Kyle Lincoln. Poyer didn't show up for voluntary organized team activities, but it's a good sign that he'll be at mandatory minicamp this week. The 31-year-old finished as the No. 13 defensive back in IDP leagues last year with 61 tackles, three sacks, seven passes defensed and five interceptions in 16 games played and will once again be in starting consideration in those league formats in 2022."

The Commanders have already placed the 24-year-old on Injured Reserve. With Mathis out for the whole season, Washington will hope both Daniel Wise and Efe Obada can step up as defensive tackle depth for the team."

It means there will be more competition for aerial targets for receivers Amari Cooper and Khalil Shakir, although they could still have hefty roles in a game that should feature plenty of offensive fireworks on both sides. The 21-year-old Coleman had 22 catches for 417 yards and three touchdowns on 36 targets in his first nine NFL games. After a long layoff, though, Coleman could struggle to get involved on Sunday, making him a shaky WR4/flex in the fantasy playoffs."

Currently, the Bills defense/special teams is ranked No. 1 overall at the position, but White's absence could cause them to slide a bit within the top five."

Franklin, a former undrafted free agent out of Temple, began his NFL career in 2020 with the Panthers and has spent all four of his NFL seasons with the organization. The 28-year-old defensive back had a career-high 30 tackles (20 solo) and an interception returned for a touchdown in 17 games (four starts) in his fourth year in Carolina in 2023. Franklin played 310 snaps on special teams and will likely continue in that role in his fifth year with the team in 2024. In his four NFL campaigns, Franklin has just 97 tackles (69 solo), one sack, the interception returned for a score, five passes defended and a force fumble in 64 games (nine starts)."

    "text": "The Buffalo Bills selected Kentucky cornerback Maxwell Hairston with the No. 30 overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft on Thursday night. Hairston is a speedy coverage cornerback deep down the field that is projected to develop into a plus starter eventually. The 5-foot-11, 183-pounder missed five games in 2024 with a shoulder injury and started seven games, totaling 19 tackles, a sack, an interception returned for a touchdown, four pass breakups and two forced fumbles. The 21-year-old stands out for his 4.28-second 40-yard dash speed, but his tackling abilities are questionable, and he could be suspect to more injuries at the NFL level while having to match up with big, physical receivers down the field. Early on in his NFL debut in 2025, Hairston probably won't play regularly, but he'll give Buffalo a speedy cover man to match up with burners on offense."

    "text": "The Buffalo Bills selected Northern Iowa offensive lineman Spencer Brown with the No. 93 overall pick in the third round of the 2021 NFL draft on Friday night. Despite being a whopping 6-foot-9, 321 pounds, Brown is really athletic as a long-term project at right tackle. He fires off the snap and has good knee bend, but he needs to improve in pass protection at the next level. The 22-year-old sat out of the 2020 season due to COVID-19, but he's shown quick hands and great power while run-blocking. With the right coaching to develop him, Brown could thrive in Buffalo's offensive scheme in the long term. The traits and tools are there, but Brown's biggest challenge will be adjusting to the level of competition in the NFL."

The 24-year-old hauled in six receptions for 39 yards in the 22-13 win over the Washington Football Team. Wilkerson is buried on the depth chart, but this kind of performance certainly helps his status on the team. Although, the Patriots added plenty of depth at receiver this offseason. It would take an impressive preseason and a few injuries for Wilkerson to have a legitimate role in this offense."

Kincaid has missed the past three games and could be in line to return to action this weekend. Kincaid was able to log three full practice sessions this week, which puts him in a great position to return to action. Before this injury, the 25-year-old has had an underwhelming season, averaging just 8.2 PPR points per game during the first ten weeks of the season. During this span, Kincaid averaged just 35.6 yards per game. If Kincaid cannot suit up, veteran Dawson Knox will continue to operate as the TE1. If he does return, fantasy managers should view him as a low-end TE1 facing the Detroit Lions, who have allowed the fewest PPR points to opposing tight ends this season."

This marks his first time back since leaving joint practice against the Los Angeles Rams on August 4th. Bosa is sure to be happy to make it back to the field after nearly three weeks off, as he has seen his last few seasons marred by injury. After appearing in just five games in 2022 due to an inguinal groin tear, a sprained foot limited him to nine games in 2023. Throughout his eight-year career, he has played in just three full seasons. However, his presence at practice is an excellent sign for him and the Chargers defense. Los Angeles presents some sneaky upside as a team defense early in the season for fantasy managers looking to stream the position, as they have three favorable matchups over the first three weeks. They'll square up against the Las Vegas Raiders, Carolina Panthers, and Pittsburgh Steelers to open the year, and a healthy Bosa can only help their case."

He's listed at No. 7 on Dane Brugler's to-100 list, so the Packers would have to trade up within the first round to snag him. If Green Bay doesn't go after McMillan, they could wait until later in the draft and take Texas' Matthew Golden, Ohio State's Emeka Egbuka or Missouri's Luther Burden III.

However, it's worth noting that he was out-snapped and out-produced by Ezekiel Elliott during their last game together in Week 6. Presumably, Dowdle will get first dibs on carrying the ball versus Atlanta, but Dallas won't shy away from riding the hot hand, especially if Elliott or Dalvin Cook play well in the opening quarter.

Renfrow's four targets are the most he's seen through four games, eclipsing his previous high of two in Week 3. With the big three of Davante Adams, Jakobi Meyers, and Josh Jacobs seeing most of the passing game usage, Renfrow has yet to have a decent fantasy game. Adams has not practiced the past two days and is currently questionable for the game on Monday night. If Adams misses, Renfrow could be in line for increased usage. That said, Renfrow did not step up in the absence of Meyers in Week 2, so it would be unwise to assume he would step up now. The 27-year-old receiver has run 83 routes and only earned a target on 8.4% of those routes. Renfrow should not be rostered by fantasy managers, given his target share and usage through the first four games this season."

It remains to be seen if Dalton will need to take time away from practice this week, but he should be considered day-to-day for now. The Panthers already named rookie first-rounder Bryce Young, the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft, as their starting signal-caller heading into the regular season. As long as the 35-year-old Dalton is healthy this year, he'll be holding a clipboard on the sidelined while helping prepare Young for his first NFL campaign. Behind Dalton, the Panthers also have second-year QB Matt Corral."

The Tennessee native played in 27 games (seven starts) during the first two seasons of his NFL career before being released by the Panthers last August and picked up by the New York Giants. He was released by New York in October and rejoined the Panthers practice squad. Now, he's back for another season and will compete for a roster spot and depth role at center and guard in 2025."

Protecting quarterback Russell Wilson has been tough for Seattle over the last couple of seasons. Drafting a guy like Lewis will definitely help fix that problem. He's above average when it comes to movement, but he lacks agility at times. Lewis gives Seattle much-needed depth at the offensive guard spot. It shouldn't take him long before he's starting for the Seahawks."

Christensen will now have to miss at least the next four weeks, and the Panthers will now be without both of their starting guards from last year for at least a few weeks. Rookie Chandler Zavala started at right guard in the season opener last week but spent most of his college career on the left side, so moving him over to the side he's most comfortable on seems like a no-brainer for the Panthers' offensive line. Starting right guard Austin Corbett (knee) began the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list and won't be eligible to return until Week 5."

Carolina made the move mostly because there just aren't many high-level tackles slated to become free agents when the new league year begins next week on March 17. The 26-year-old started and played in all 16 games in 2020 and graded out as Pro Football Focus' No. 13 offensive tackle. Moton was a second-round selection in 2017 and has played nearly every snap on the team's offensive line -- he missed six snaps in 2019 -- since he entered the league. He's the third offensive tackle that Carolina has tagged in franchise history."

Cornerback Sauce Gardner is another candidate to go with the Jets first pick of the draft. The Jets have bigger needs on the defensive line and in the secondary, so it will be interesting to see if they pass on Ekwonu if he's available. Some talent evaluators rate Gardner as the No. 2 prospect in the draft, and the Jets view him as a true lockdown cornerback. The Jets like pass-rushers Kayvon Thibodeaux from Oregon and Jermaine Johnson II from Florida State, but fourth overall is too high for them. Either player would be in consideration at No. 10 overall if the Jets hang onto that pick."

In addition to the stress fracture that was discovered this week, Ainias fractured his leg in 2022.

Evans was one of PFF's highest-rated tight ends in the country before the ACL injury that ended his 2023 season.

Burden earned first-team All-SEC honors in 2024 after leading the Tigers with 61 catches for 676 receiving yards and six receiving touchdowns. He was even better in 2023 with 86 catches for 1,212 yards and 9 receiving touchdowns. He joins a very crowded wide receiver room alongside DJ Moore and Rome Odunze, but he gives the Bears even more options for second-year QB Caleb Williams in new head coach Ben Johnson's offense. If Burden steps in as the primary slot receiver in Johnson's system, he could be set for a huge rookie year as he plays the role that made Amon-Ra St. Brown a star in Detroit. He'll be high-risk until we get a clearer picture of his role, but he has a very high ceiling if he secures enough of the target share in Chicago."

The former undrafted free agent out of Florida International has only appeared in four NFL games, though, with all of them coming back in 2022. In his four games for the Lions, he caught his only target for a gain of seven yards. Alexander will head to Chicago with a firm grasp of Johnson's offensive concepts, although he will still be a long shot to make the 53-man active roster to begin the 2025 season out of training camp.

This will be a camp battle worth monitoring, as it was presumed Jahan Dotson had the inside edge in this role. Dotson is listed as the current WR2 on Washington's unofficial depth chart, but Zaccheaus will also have Dyami Brown and rookie Luke McCaffrey to contend with for playing time. He's nothing more than a late-draft dart throw or waiver-wire fodder until the situation is more concrete. Zaccheaus is Yahoo!'s WR145."

Odunze finished with five receptions for 39 yards but was kept out of the end zone for another week. While the other Bears playmakers were more involved in this contest, limiting Odunze's opportunities, he still made several key plays. Late in the game, with the Bears needing to generate big plays to stay in the contest, Odunze was targeted and showed his ability to step up in crucial moments. Although he didn't find the end zone, the rookie wideout continues to demonstrate promise as a dependable option. With a quick turnaround, Odunze and the Bears will face the NFC-leading Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving Thursday, looking to bounce back."

However, this week presents a far more formidable challenge. The 49ers rank 4th in the NFL in passing yards allowed, limiting opponents to just 190 yards per game. Adding to Williams' concerns are the injuries to two of his top playmakers, D'Andre Swift (quadriceps) and DJ Moore (quadriceps), both of whom are listed as questionable. While both players practiced on a limited basis Friday, their availability for Sunday remains uncertain. If Swift and Moore can suit up, Williams could be a borderline QB1 for Week 14. However, without them, it's hard to feel confident starting him in most fantasy leagues."

The Patriots' defense has struggled against the run this season, ranking 26th in rushing yards allowed and 21st in scoring defense, which presents a favorable matchup for Johnson. However, Johnson's role remains uncertain, with the Bears still trying to find their offensive rhythm. Until the Bears can stabilize their offensive game plan, Johnson remains more of a stash or desperation flex option rather than a reliable start. If you require a high-risk, high-reward play, Johnson's matchup could provide some upside, but proceed cautiously."

Ideally, Atlanta would love to re-sign him, but Dalman will likely get offered more on the open market, with ESPN's Jeremy Fowler saying Dalman will easily top the free-agent market at the position. Meanwhile, the Falcon will tender restricted free-agent center Ryan Neuzil, who will end up replacing Dalman. It remains to be seen if Dalman will top Creed Humphrey's four-year, $72 million deal, but either way, he's going to do pretty well for himself. In addition to Dalman, Fowler notes that Green Bay Packers impending center Josh Myers should have a strong market in free agency after avoiding what looked like a potential serious injury in the playoffs."

Trapilo played both left and right tackle in college, so he could be called upon to step in for Jones if needed. Alongside new playcaller Ben Johnson, better offensive line play in Chicago is a reason for optimism around second-year quarterback Caleb Williams."

Sweat's draft stock dropped significantly because of a heart issue that made many teams take him off their draft boards entirely. He showed excellent combine speed and has incredibly long arms. Sweat is a gifted athlete, so he could be an absolute steal in this draft if his health issues don't hamper him in his NFL career. Washington needs a pass rusher to replace Preston Smith, so Sweat should help them do that."

With Cincinnati unlikely to make the playoffs, there may be a point where it wouldn't make sense for Chase to be on the field. However, he's still a must-start for the Week 14 meeting against a shoddy Cowboys defense."

Over his past five contests, the Clemson product has averaged a stellar 18.3 PPR points per game. During this stretch has averaged a strong 77.3 yards per game and has found the end zone four times. He has also seen double-digit targets in three of these five contests. Despite facing a tough Denver secondary that has allowed the seventh-fewest PPR points to opposing wideouts, Higgins should be locked into all lineups as a solid WR2."

Carl Granderson might be the favorite to start, but Payton Turner is closer than not to being labeled a bust, and Marcus Davenport is gone. Foskey has a reasonable chance to at least be a rotational pass-rusher in his first NFL season. He fits the Saints' size profile for a 4-3 defensive end at 6-foot-5 and 264 pounds. The 22-year-old was productive in college in his last two seasons at Notre Dame, too, with 11 sacks in each season. He also led FBS with six forced fumbles in 2021 and blocked four punts in college."

He has a high motor at the next level, which gives him a high ceiling at the next level. Ossai has a big frame (6-foot-4, 253 pounds), but he'll need to refine his hand usage in the NFL in order to be more consistent. He has good bend around the edge and has the potential to be a dangerous speed rusher for Cincy. Ossai has the versatility to be a 4-3 player or a standup guy in a 3-4 scheme that can drop into coverage."

    "text": "Texas A&M defensive lineman Shemar Stewart wowed scouts during last week's Senior Bowl with his power off the edge, according to ESPN's Pete Thamel. Stewart stands at 6-foot-5 and 281 pounds, and his 83-inch wingspan is the same as Jadeveon Clowney. ESPN's Jeremy Fowler says that Stewart received the most \"wow\" responses of all the first-round talents for this year's NFL draft. However, he doesn't come without risk, as he only had 4.5 sacks in three years and 1.5 sacks in 2024. \"He stamped himself as the best player,\" an NFL personnel evaluator said. There's no denying Stewart's physical prowess, but many NFL teams could be torn on draft day between his production at the collegiate level and his potential at the next level. Either way, someone will be taking a chance on him in the first round in April."

Murphy should immediately contribute on the defensive side of the ball for the Bengals in his rookie year, and he could end up being a steal in this draft. The 21-year-old measures in at 6-foot-5, 268 pounds, which is big for an edge rusher. He makes up for being oversized at the position by having great speed and length, which allows him to contribute as both a pass-rusher and run-stopper. There aren't many holes in his game after leading the Tigers in both sacks and tackles for loss in each of the last three years. Murphy could quickly become an option for fantasy managers in IDP formats."

He has great length, athleticism and recovery speed in the secondary. Newsome was glued to receivers in college and has the tools to be a pretty good lockdown cornerback, if he can stay healthy. He doesn't have excellent size, though, which could be a problem against big-bodied receivers in the NFL. Newsome is definitely more of a man-coverage guy."

Despite his increased production in tackles, Emerson was a liability in coverage and allowed a team-high six touchdowns."

The plus matchup gives some optimism for Watson to have a good game, although he failed to capitalize on a similarly good matchup against the Washington Commanders last week, throwing for just 125 yards and one touchdown. The Cleveland offense looks broken with the offensive line banged up, Watson playing poorly, and the receivers struggling with drops, making it very tough to trust the Browns' quarterback in fantasy leagues this week. Treat Watson as a low-end QB2 for Week 6."

Interestingly, Shedeur Sanders, who was once mentioned as a candidate for Cleveland at No. 2 overall, remains available as many quarterback-needy teams opt for different players. Gabriel played six seasons of college football, with stops at UCF, Oklahoma, and Oregon. Replacing Bo Nix with the Ducks in 2024, Gabriel completed 326 of his 447 pass attempts for 3,857 yards, 30 touchdowns, and six interceptions. He also showcased his mobility with 149 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns.

Szmyt was on Cleveland's roster this offseason until the team waived him earlier in the month. However, he's back now with the release of defensive lineman Ogbo Okoronkwo earlier in the day. The Syracuse product has yet to attempt a kick on an NFL field but will compete with veteran teammate Dustin Hopkins for the Browns' starting job. In college, Szmyt was 85-for-105 (81%) on field-goal attempts and hit extra-point tries at a stellar 98% clip."

    "text": "Cleveland Browns tight end David Njoku (hamstring) remained sidelined during Friday's practice, according to Daniel Oyefusi of ESPN. This is not a good sign for the tight end's availability for this weekend, as he has not been able to practice once this week. Fantasy managers should monitor Friday's injury report, as Njoku will likely carry an injury designation into the weekend. Over the past two weeks, Njoku has enjoyed two big performances, averaging an impressive 21.7 PPR points per game during this stretch and scoring three touchdowns. If Njoku cannot turn the corner, fantasy managers should expect Jordan Akins to operate as the TE1 for Cleveland. Akins got a few starting opportunities earlier in the season when Njoku missed time and could be worth a look in deeper 14+ team formats facing the Kansas City Chiefs, who have allowed the second-most PPR points to opposing tight ends this season."

Whiteheart went undrafted out of Wake Forest in 2023 and spent time with the Arizona Cardinals last season before signing with Cleveland's practice squad this summer. He has been active recently in the absence of David Njoku and caught three of his four targets for 13 yards and a touchdown in four games this season. Njoku suffered a knee injury in his return to action in Week 5, so Whiteheart's release could be an indication that his injury is not considered serious. Whiteheart was not on the fantasy football radar before his release and, it would be surprising if he enters it any time soon."

He has a great frame and size at the position and could become an immediate contributor for a much-improved Buccaneers defense as they look to defend their Super Bowl crown. There are plenty of questions with Tryon, especially since he took a year off, but he has more than enough talent to threaten NFL offensive tackles."

    "text": "Dallas Cowboys safety Markquese Bell (shoulder) will have season-ending shoulder surgery in the near future, according to head coach Mike McCarthy. Bell suffered a dislocated left shoulder covering a kickoff in the second quarter of the Monday night loss to the Houston Texans when trying to tackle running back Dameon Pierce. It's the latest in a long string of injuries to key players for the Cowboys on both sides of the ball in 2024. Defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence (foot) has been on Injured Reserve since Week 4, and cornerback DaRon Bland (foot) has yet to play this year after having foot surgery in August. However, Dallas' defense could get a big boost if Bland is able to make his 2024 debut this Sunday against the division-rival Washington Commanders. Dallas' D/special teams won't be a recommended fantasy play in Week 12."

Blue is expected to have a big role on offense and is very explosive, but it's not a great sign for him heading into training camp. The 21-year-old is also under 200 pounds and comes with ball-security issues from his college days. The Cowboys like Blue's speed and explosiveness, but he didn't work at all with the first-team offense in spring workouts, suggesting Dallas could open the year with a backfield consisting mostly of Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders. The Cowboys will be hoping that Blue can mature quickly, but he's also no lock to make the roster out of training camp."

Brooks will serve as the change-of-pace back behind starter Chuba Hubbard on Sunday and most likely for the rest of the 2024 season, relegating Sanders to the RB3 role whenever he recovers from his ankle injury."

    "text": "The Los Angeles Chargers traded with the New England Patriots and selected Oklahoma linebacker Kenneth Murray with the No. 23 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft on Thursday. It's the Chargers second first-rounder, as they took Oregon QB Justin Herbert sixth overall. The Bolts are getting a three-down linebacker who can cause chaos from sideline to sideline. He plays downhill with tremendous physicality and energy, and he's a player that most teams were infatuated with on and off the field in the pre-draft process. The middle of the defense was the Chargers weakness, so Murray should fit in right away to improve that weakness. LA's defense/special teams should be highly coveted by fantasy owners with Murray now in the fold. The Patriots received a second- and third-round pick from the Chargers with this swap."

Guyton is an ascending tackle prospect that could develop into a high-level pass protector of quarterback Dak Prescott with the proper coaching. He plays with great leverage and has great physical traits at 6-foot-8, 322 pounds with 34 1/8-inch arms. There have been injury concerns with the 22-year-old, though, and it remains to be seen if he can develop into a starting-caliber left or right tackle in the NFL. Guyton doesn't have a lot of experience at the tackle position, but he could be competing for Dallas' starting left-tackle job right away in 2024 to replace Tyron Smith."

The Cowboys had one of the best offensive lines in all of football several years ago, but that's no longer the case, and Dallas really needed to address the position, so this pick makes perfect sense. The 21-year-old may not be great right away in the NFL, but he does have plenty of upside at both tackle and guard, which will give the Cowboys some flexibility. Smith stands at an imposing 6-foot-5, 324 pounds, and he had a 5.02-second 40-yard dash at the combine back in February. It's more likely that Smith is starting at a guard spot in the NFL initially."

Dallas has lost future Hall of Fame offensive linemen Tyron Smith and Zack Martin over the last two offseasons, so the group is in transition heading into the 2025 campaign. Given Dak Prescott's injury troubles, the organization should put a heavy emphasis on improving from last year's group."

Lamb finished the contest having played a season-low 68 percent of the offensive snaps, spending a good portion of the second half on the sideline without his helmet. It's unclear if Lamb was sidelined due to performance or injury. It's worth noting that he did seem to react to a potential shoulder injury after being taken down by a defender, but the Cowboys never made any sort of injury report announcement regarding Lamb. Regardless of whether he's injured, fantasy managers can be rightfully disappointed about Lamb's quiet showing in a game where other Dallas pass-catchers, such as Brandin Cooks, KaVontae Turpin, and Luke Schoonmaker, thrived. If healthy, Lamb will look to bounce back as a low-end WR1 in fantasy football against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 14."

    "text": "With the No. 9 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, the Denver Broncos have selected Alabama defensive back Patrick Surtain II. It's a surprising move as many thought the Broncos would go quarterback, but maybe there's some truth to the trade rumors for Aaron Rodgers that emerged on Thursday. The Broncos add one of the two best corners in this draft and arguably the best cover guy. Surtain only had four interceptions in three years in college, but he does a good job preventing catches. Denver should have an improved defense next year after allowing the 16th-most passing yards in 2020."

Lutz had an expected dud in last week's loss to the division-rival Los Angeles Chargers, making just one field goal and one extra point. In six games in his second season in Denver, he's averaging 8.0 fantasy points per week, which ranks 15th among all kickers. The 30-year-old sits 10th in overall fantasy points and has attempted 14 field goals through six games, which is tied for seventh. The Broncos offense hasn't been anything special in 2024, but they should at least be able to give Lutz enough opportunities to make him a deep-league streamer against a Saints defense that is allowing the fifth-most fantasy points per game to opposing kickers this year."

He also tallied 1,577 rushing yards, 267 receiving yards, and three receiving touchdowns. The Broncos let Javonte Williams walk during free agency and will presumably give Harvey an opportunity to compete for the starting running back job over Jaleel McLaughlin and Audric Estime."

Jeudy is now gone, but Mims will be competing for snaps with Josh Reynolds, Tim Patrick and rookie Troy Franklin.

    "text": "The Denver Broncos made it clear at last week's NFL Combine that Drew Sanders will be a permanent part of the linebacker room in 2025, especially with Cody Barton and Justin Strnad both set to be unrestricted free agents next week and Alex Singleton (knee) coming off an ACL injury. Head coach Sean Payton and general manager George Paton said Sanders will work this offseason at inside linebacker, and they have high expectations for him. \"We think Sanders can be a starter in this league at linebacker,\" Paton said. It doesn't mean the Broncos won't add to the position in free agency, though, and Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Zack Baun and Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton could be targets for the Broncos. Baun was a former draft pick when Payton was with the Saints, so he could be the big free-agent splash Denver makes this offseason."

Vaughn is only 5-foot-6, 176 pounds, the shortest player to be measured at the NFL combine. He's been stellar with the fundamentals and has been above-average in the passing game. His routes are crisp and his hands have been a sure thing. Pass protection could be an issue because of his size, but his abilities on special teams also add to his value for a potential roster spot. The sixth-rounder won't be on the fantasy radar for 2023 drafts, but he could provide depth behind Tony Pollard, Malik Davis, Rico Dowdle and Ronald Jones."

In the 38-6 blowout victory, Adkins caught his only target for a 12-yard touchdown score that put the Broncos on the scoreboard early in the first quarter. They would never look back, with rookie quarterback Bo Nix throwing for over 300 yards and a career-high four touchdowns. Adkins' first touchdown of the year came in the Week 8 win over the Carolina Panthers. The 25-year-old shouldn't be a waiver-wire consideration at all this upcoming week after his second score, as he now has only six receptions for 34 yards and two TDs on seven targets in 11 games in 2024. There's a good chance we won't hear from the second-year TE again."

He will now be under contract with the team through the 2025 season. Franklin-Myers has 15 tackles (seven solo), five quarterback hits, a forced fumble and three sacks in four starts this season in his third year in the NFL. In his first two seasons with the Jets, the 25-year-old had 14 solo tackles, 13 QB hits, three fumble recoveries and five sacks in 31 games (two starts). Franklin-Myers has seen at least 63 percent of the defensive snaps in each game so far this season, so he's clearly taken on a much bigger role in 2021."

The 24-year-old pass-rusher battled through his ankle issue last year and managed to play in 15 games, recording a career-high 48 tackles (30 solo), five tackles for loss, 14 QB hits, a career-high four sacks, one interception, four passes defensed and three fumble recoveries (one for a touchdown). If fully healthy, he should have a big role on the Cardinals defensive line as he heads into the final year of his rookie contract."

He can also contribute on special teams as a returner, but he has no significance to fantasy owners in IDP leagues. Reed was a fifth-round pick by San Fran in 2018 out of Kansas State.

He played very well in his rookie season last year and reports stated he was \"one of the best players on the field\" throughout the Eagles offseason program. Ronald Darby and Jalen Mills seem to be atop the depth chart, but both have legitimate injury concerns which could open up a starting role for Maddox. Even if both guys are healthy, Maddox has looked good enough to earn some time in base packages besides playing his role as slot corner."

But as the Ravens Defense continues to deal with injuries -- particularly in the secondary -- they could be getting a key piece back in Marlon Humphrey, who is expected to clear COVID-19 protocol in time to suit up for Week 10 against New England. Humphrey has built on his 2019 All-Pro campaign by compiling a league-high four forced fumbles in addition to 2.5 sacks, 40 tackles, and an interception through his first seven games. The Baltimore defense has trended toward being one of the elite units in the league through the first half of the season, and a matchup against a floundering Patriots offense will only garner the group more intrigue. Check back throughout the week for updates on Humphrey and Co., but all signs point toward the Ravens being one of the most sought-after Week 10 defenses."

The Lions drafted Mahogany in the sixth round out of Boston College in 2024, and he played well in a spot-starter role as a rookie. Pro Football Focus graded Mahogany seventh-highest out of 136 qualified guards, albeit in a small sample size of just 75 snaps. Detroit lost 2024 starting right guard Kevin Zeitler to free agency and All-Pro center Frank Ragnow to retirement, so the interior of their offensive line is in flux. Mahogany's performance will undoubtedly play a role in the fantasy production of Lions running backs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery."

Awosika will return to Detroit for his fourth season in 2025 after serving as a rotational offensive lineman with the team since 2022. The 26-year-old offensive guard went undrafted out of Buffalo but made his NFL debut in 2021 with the Philadelphia Eagles, when he appeared in just one game that year. He has started only seven of the 36 games that he's appeared in over his three seasons with the Lions. There's a chance that Awosika could have a bigger role on the interior of the Lions' offensive line in 2025, but he will have to earn more playing time by standing out in training camp this summer and in preseason games."

With LaPorta out this weekend, expect both Brock Wright and Shane Zylstra to see the field more in two-TE sets, with Wright being the better target as a TE2 streamer in deeper leagues and DFS. LaPorta's absence should also mean more targets for receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown, Tim Patrick and Kalif Raymond."

He has the ability to dominant man-to-man matchups with offensive guards but will need to work on his hands at the next level with the Lions.

Jacobs was a fixture of the 49ers' second level as he ripped off multiple runs of 10-plus yards and ended up with 106 rushing yards on 26 carries. Scoring all three touchdowns from one yard out in the second, third, and fourth quarters, Jacobs was the finisher and was the key part of the Packers' huge win. After this huge game where he no doubt delighted Packers fans and fantasy managers alike, Jacobs will set his sights on the Miami Dolphins on Thanksgiving. Jacobs will be a locked-in RB1 against Miami in that matchup on Thursday night."

In other words, the Packers did not practice on Wednesday, but if they had, Watson would not have participated. The 25-year-old injured his knee during Monday night's win over the New Orleans Saints. His game was abbreviated as he played just 43 percent of the offensive snaps, exiting the contest with one target and zero receptions. Watson has been a hit-or-miss fantasy receiver this season, and even if he suits up against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 17, most managers can justify leaving him on the bench."

In Week 17, the Packers will head to U.S. Bank Stadium to face the Minnesota Vikings, where Love will be a low-end QB1 for fantasy managers."

The former second-rounder finished as the WR26 in half-PPR scoring and will open his third season as a boom/bust WR3/flex option for fantasy managers."

Wicks, meanwhile, will hope to contribute something after going catchless on three targets in the Week 9 loss to the division-rival Detroit Lions. He does have four touchdowns on the season, but he has only eclipsed 50 receiving yards in a game once in nine games and not since Sept. 29 against the Minnesota Vikings. The 23-year-old has 16 receptions for 192 total yards and is outside the top-50 wideout in average fantasy points per game. Wicks profiles as a low-upside, touchdown-dependent flex option in deeper fantasy leagues against Chicago."

The 31-year-old continues to be one of the more reliable kickers in the NFL with a strong leg, although he made only 77.8 percent of a career-high 36 field-goal tries in 2022. Fantasy-wise, the problem with McManus is he just wasn't scoring points with enough regularity, and he finished as the No. 22 kicker in the league in overall fantasy points in one of the lowest-scoring offenses in football. If Russell Wilson and Company can figure things out this offseason with a new head coach in tow, McManus could jump back onto the fantasy radar in 2023."

The Ravens didn't place a restricted free-agent tender on him but brought him back on a non-restricted free-agent deal. Welch will return to Baltimore for his fourth season after originally joining the franchise as an undrafted free agent in 2020. In his three years with the team, he has 21 tackles (nine solo) in 43 games played (zero starts). The 24-year-old appeared in all 17 regular season games for the Ravens in 2022, playing mostly on special teams. Welch is likely to have a similar role in 2023 and can be avoided in all IDP fantasy leagues."

Cooper has absorbed new defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley's scheme seamlessly after being taken as the first off-ball linebacker in this year's draft at No. 45 overall. The 6-foot-2, 229-pounder has showed impressive speed this offseason, and his eight sacks in his final season at Texas A&M stood out. Cooper has a clear path to earning the starting middle linebacker spot in Green Bay this year after the departure of De'Vondre Campbell. A duo of Cooper and Quay Walker in the middle of the Packers' defense could be nasty in 2024."

Williams, who is listed as an offensive guard, stands at 6-foot-4 and 322 pounds. He didn't play much in college until his senior year at Cincinnati, and he represents a developmental offensive-guard prospect for the Packers heading into the 2025 season this fall. Williams has good size but lacks agility, which is why he'll likely stick on the interior."

Without Jenkins protecting his blindside, quarterback Aaron Rodgers could face a long evening of running from former Pro Bowl defensive end Nick Bosa, who has amassed four quarterback hits and three sacks in his first two games. The result could be quicker passes from Rodgers and/or an increased focus on the run game in an effort to minimize the impact of Jenkins' absence.
