Wow, well this could end up being a steal for the Cardinals as Johnson fell in the draft likely due to injury concerns. Johnson was viewed as a Day 1 prospect, but being limited to seven games last season probably hurt his draft stock. When healthy, Johnson has proven to be an elite zone coverage defensive back with good size and length. He finished his college career with 57 tackles, nine interceptions, and three returned touchdowns. Johnson should be a Day 1 starter and an immediate impact player on defense in Arizona."

It was tough sledding for Murray and the Cardinals offense in Seattle a week ago. The Cardinals failed to produce a touchdown, and Murray threw a momentum-shifting pick-six that set the Cardinals' comeback hopes back by a large margin. However, the Cardinals' offense should return to its usual form this week. The Vikings' stout defense presents a challenge for the Cardinals' passing attack, but this is a unit that has earned its trust. The matchup makes Murray a low-end QB start, but he should still be started in Week 14."

He's not quite on the IDP radar just yet, but Wilson is one to keep an eye on after an impressive rookie season. Hopefully his injury in training camp isn't a serious one."

With both Dortch and Marquise Brown (heel) up in the air for this weekend, Zach Pascal could join Rondale Moore and rookie Michael Wilson in three-receiver sets versus the Bears."

Browning is underrated because of his size (6-foot-3, 240 pounds), but he has prototypical size to play the Mike linebacker position as a run-stopping force. He also has enough mobility to drop into zone coverage, which will give defensive-minded head coach Vic Fangio some intriguing possibilities to confuse the opposing offense. His size could also make him an option for covering tight ends. Browning's advanced technique and awareness of the game give him the necessary intangibles. Can be hurt by his aggressiveness, but over time, Browning could become an excellent all-around linebacker."

The Cardinals' offense has struggled to establish a run game, especially after their poor performance against the Seahawks in Week 13, where Conner was limited to just eight yards on seven carries. However, Conner's five targets in the passing game show that the team is still committed to keeping him involved in their offense. Even with the difficult matchup, Conner's steady involvement in the passing game gives him a solid floor for fantasy points, especially in PPR formats. The Vikings' defense has been relatively middle-of-the-pack against the run, so while Conner may not have a high ceiling this week, he can still provide decent fantasy value as a low-end RB2. The key for Conner is his volume, and barring a drastic change in game script, he should see enough touches to justify a start in most lineups."

Meanwhile, Maye, the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, has steadily improved. He led the Patriots' offense to 10 points, including a rushing touchdown, during 25 snaps against the Philadelphia Eagles in preseason action. Mayo has praised Maye's commitment and progress since joining the team. The upcoming preseason finale against the Commanders will be crucial for the coaching staff to evaluate the quarterbacks in a game-like scenario. Regardless of who secures the starting role, neither quarterback is expected to have a significant fantasy impact."

And with Wilson also banged up, Greg Dortch could be a popular streaming option if one or both of Harrison or Wilson are out or limited. Tight end Trey McBride would also have a much higher fantasy ceiling. The next couple days of practice will give us a much better idea of the statuses of Harrison and Wilson for Monday night.

    "text": "Arizona Cardinals running back Trey Benson finished the preseason with 17 carries for 64 rushing yards. The third-round pick out of Florida State was once believed to be a threat to James Conner's playing time but it appears the rookie will have to wait a while before he makes his mark on the league. In recent comments to the press, offensive coordinator Drew Petzing reaffirmed the team's commitment to using Conner as their primary running back, referring to him as the \"bell cow in that room.\" While Benson's performance during training camp and the preseason solidified his role as Conner's direct backup, not much should be expected of the rookie out of the gate. Given Conner's injury history, Benson is certainly a worthwhile bench stash but the bench is exactly where he should be on fantasy rosters in Week 1."

I know I will.\" He was ineligible for the 2019 season at Washington State after reportedly taking an unapproved over-the-counter supplement from a nutrition store. The Cardinals DST remains nothing more than a low-end No. 2 unit in most fantasy formats heading into 2019."

Robinson weighed in at 285 pounds and has long arms and plenty of power to push his way to opposing quarterbacks. He's also serviceable in the run game and will compete for plenty of playing time right away in the desert in 2024 next to Zaven Collins and BJ Ojulari.

Johnson started at right guard before moving to left tackle in 2022, and he allowed just two sacks all year.

Northwestern's Peter Skoronski is believed to be an offensive guard at the next level. Johnson is considered the cleanest tackle and could be off the board early in the first round. If the Arizona Cardinals are able to trade out of the No. 3 spot and move down, they could target Johnson."

In addition, Marquise Brown (ankle), who was activated from the injured reserve list on Saturday following a five-game absence, could be on a snap count on Sunday, so Brown and Baccellia may see a few looks from Kyler Murray, with the former being more likely to get involved. Yet, neither man is worth an add in any fantasy format."

A 6-foot-3, 235-pound rookie behemoth out of Stanford, Higgins is currently nestled behind starter Trey McBride on the team's depth chart. While he has excellent speed for his size and good hands, at this point he's nothing more than a handcuff for McBride and currently remains off the fantasy radar. Higgins and the rest of the Arizona offense will take on the Chicago Bears in Week 16."

He has mainly been getting increased reps due to the fact Jordan Addison (concussion) is sidelined right now. Jackson is making the most of his chances and could earn that final wideout spot. However, there's a good chance he ends up on the practice squad, so it's unlikely Jackson will provide fantasy value this season."

It was just the fourth time in ten games that the 23-year-old was held out of the end zone, but it was the fourth time this season that he's garnered double-digit targets and the seventh game with six or more receptions, making him one of the more reliable wideouts for fantasy. The former first-round draft pick is top 10 in the league in targets (82) and receptions (58) through ten weeks, but it will be tough sledding next week in Denver as the Falcons will face a stout Broncos pass defense.

    "text": "Atlanta Falcons tight end Kyle Pitts recorded his first multi-catch performance since Week 10 on Monday night, catching all four of his targets for a modest 28 yards in the 15-9 win over the Raiders. On a night when Kirk Cousins completed just 11 passes, Pitts' four targets and four catches were both a team-high. It was good to see the 24-year-old involved again, although the Raiders had been poor against TEs this year and Cousins wasn't looking downfield much in this one so it's not all that surprising to see him resurface. Between Pitts disappearing from the passing attack most weeks and Cousins looking dysfunctional at quarterback over the last several games, fantasy managers vying for playoff championships will want to look elsewhere next Sunday. The Falcons take on the Giants who have allowed the third-fewest fantasy points to TEs on the season, and the former first-round pick figures to be a low-end TE2 in that matchup."

    "text": "The Atlanta Falcons selected Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. with the eighth overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft on Thursday night. This is the first real surprise of this year's draft after the Falcons signed quarterback Kirk Cousins this offseason. Injuries are the main concern for Penix, but besides that, he showed plenty of long-term upside in his two seasons with the Huskies, culminating in a national championship appearance earlier this year. The 23-year-old lefty will obviously enter his first season in the NFL as a clear backup in Atlanta, but this pick will give the Falcons insurance with Cousins returning from a torn Achilles in 2023. This selection will be debated for a while, especially given all of Atlanta's needs on defense."

Instead, Walker will have a private workout for NFL teams on April 17. Walker, who is one of the top edge rushers in this year's draft class, also didn't work out at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis last week. In his latest mock draft, ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. has Walker as the No. 8 overall player, while he's considered a top-10 player on ESPN's consensus draft board. He measured at 6-foot-1, 243 pounds at the Combine with an arm span of 79 7/8 inches. Walker earned the Butkus Award in 2024 as the nation's top linebacker by leading the Bulldogs in tackles for loss (10.5) and sacks (6.5). His quad injury shouldn't negatively affect his draft stock."

The more likely outcome this offseason is that the Falcons end up trading Cousins to a team looking for a veteran QB while they find their signal-caller of the future in the draft. If Cousins were to be cut before June 1, he'd carry a $65 million cap hit for 2025. The 36-year-old is also due a $10 million roster cut on March 17, so if he's not traded, Atlanta is expected to cut him before then. Cousins was benched for Penix in Week 16 and ended up being a bust after signing a four-year, $180 million deal last offseason. The four-time Pro Bowler threw for 3,508 yards, 18 touchdowns and a league-high 16 interceptions in his 14 starts."

The Bucs have struggled to stop the run this year, too. Robinson has struggled so far, and Allgeier's runs have been much more successful on average.

The rookie out of Michigan State got the most run of all the Falcon running backs, adding two catches for nine yards to his stat line, while Jashaun Corbin touched the ball six times and Elijah Dotson received three carries and one reception. Carter's run featured some good vision and breakaway speed, a couple of traits that should go a long way in helping to secure a roster spot as the regular season nears."

Krieg visited with the Falcons a day after he kicked at the league's International Player Pathway program. Although he had other visits scheduled with NFL teams, the Falcons liked him enough to get a deal done before that could happen. Atlanta still has Younghoe Koo on their roster, but he missed three games in 2024 due to a hip injury, finished the year on Injured Reserve, and also made a career-low 74 percent of his 34 field-goal attempts (6-for-9 from 50-plus yards) in his sixth year with the organization. Riley Patterson is also on the team's roster at kicker this offseason. Krieg and Patterson will give Koo competition in training camp this summer, but as long as Koo is healthy, he'll be the favorite to remain as Atlanta's primary kicker."

His focus will shift to recovering fully in time for the start of the 2025 season. The 23-year-old former Washington Husky would have had a significant role in Atlanta's defense right away in his rookie season, but now he'll have to wait until next year to make an impact. Trice's injury will put more pressure on outside linebackers Arnold Ebiketie and Lorenzo Carter to perform in 2024."

I think hell overcome it. Floyd has played in just 22 games in his first two seasons in the NFL and has recorded 11.5 sacks and 67 tackles in that time. A healthy return of Floyd is much needed in order for Chicago to put up a consistent pass rush in 2018."

Washington racked up just 1,508 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns in 55 collegiate games, but Atlanta clearly liked something they saw on tape, and his performance in practice is all that matters from this point on.

Onyemata claims that he has never \"knowingly taken anything that could cause a positive test,\" but he will be suspended regardless. The 28-year-old is a key defender for the Saints, so this is a big blow in the early part of the season. Onyemata started 30 games the last two years and has 16 sacks and 167 tackles in his five-year career in New Orleans. He's one of the better interior defenders in the league, and his 46 QB pressures in 2020 ranked 13th among all defensive interior players, according to Pro Football Focus."

The 27-year-old Street was serving as defensive line depth in Philly behind Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham, so he should see more playing time immediately in Atlanta. Street, a fourth-round pick by the San Francisco 49ers in 2018 out of North Carolina State, had just four tackles (two solo) in eight games (one start) in 2023 with the Eagles."

With plenty of work to get under the salary cap this season, New Orleans has also considered trading defensive tackle Malcom Brown. Brown is in the final year of a three-year deal and his departure, combined with Onyemata's restructure, would clear nearly $10 million in salary cap space. The Saints are likely to continue with smaller re-signings and restructures in the coming days and weeks."

Dallas defense has been steadily rising in season-long drafts as of late, largely due to the additions of Everson Griffen and Dontari Poe along the defensive line.

Head coach John Harbaugh said he expects Ali to be fully ready for training camp at the end of July. If he's healthy and doesn't suffer a setback this summer, the 23-year-old will be competing for a spot on the team's regular-season roster as RB depth. As things stand now, the Ravens RB room consists of Derrick Henry, Keaton Mitchell, Justice Hill, Owen Wright, Ali and fellow rookie Chris Collier."

Per Rapoport, the injury occurred during conditioning. It's devastating news for the 25-year-old and the Ravens' defense, as 2024 was his best season as a pro. After appearing in just eight games (one start) over his first three campaigns with the team, Washington played in all of them last season, starting ten games and boasting career-highs in tackles (62) and securing his first two interceptions. Despite being listed as a second-string defensive back, the TCU product logged nearly 65% of Baltimore's defensive snaps in 2024. Teammates Sanoussi Kane and Beau Brade currently project as the players who will benefit most regarding playing time, though the team could use a mix of assets to play in his stead."

Loop is the favorite to succeed Tucker, but The Athletic's Jeff Zrebiec thinks the Ravens could be headed for their first training camp kicking competition since Tucker beat out Billy Cundiff in 2012. John Hoyland, an undrafted rookie out of Wyoming, has been good enough to suggest that he could push Loop for the starting gig in training camp and the preseason this fall. The 23-year-old Loop impressed the coaching staff during offseason workouts after making 83.6% of his field goals in his four seasons with the Wildcats in college. Loop could be a bit inconsistent in his rookie season if he wins the job, but given the offense he's in, he could be fantasy relevant immediately."

Harbaugh and the Ravens are \"optimistic\" about the 22-year-old returning at some point this season. However, he has yet to progress enough to consider being taken off the Physically Unable to Perform list. Mitchell, whose stint on the PUP stems from a knee injury he suffered in Week 15 of last season, was reported on by his head coach two weeks ago to be \"right on schedule,\" and \"the schedule is for him to be back this season.\" They're vague comments from the long-time Ravens head coach, though Baltimore doesn't necessarily need Mitchell right now with the backfield duo of Derrick Henry and Justice Hill performing admirably in a high-powered attack. Still, he'll evidently suit up at some point in 2024. When that will be remains to be seen."

In his five years with the Ravens, he has only 29 receptions on 40 targets for 167 yards and five touchdowns, adding three carries for three yards in 70 games (29 starts). Ricard was the most-used fullback in the NFL last season and gives Baltimore's running attack a big boost.

The good news is the 27-year-old has an extra day to try and clear the concussion protocol this week, and the fact he was in a non-contact jersey on Thursday helps his chances. Hill has become less attractive as a deep-league flex at RB since the return of second-year back Keaton Mitchell. Fantasy managers will most likely want to avoid Hill this week since he's most likely going to at least be questionable to play on Monday. If Hill doesn't get the green light to face the Bolts, rookie Rasheen Ali would be in line to be active behind Derrick Henry and Mitchell."

At 6-foot-4 and 214 pounds, Higgins posted a 4.47 forty-yard dash at the 2025 NFL Combine and is one of the better athletes in this year's class.

Stanley will certainly be missed against a Washington Football team defense that ranks second in the league in sacks. D.J. Fluker will fill in at tackle for Stanley. Washington will likely be without Chase Young (groin), which would be a lucky break for the Ravens. The status of Stanley isn't enough to downgrade any Ravens fantasy players, though it could make things just a bit harder against a strong defense."

I feel like I can win a foot race with anybody, so I try to make everything a foot race.\" Walker still has plenty of things to work on as he transitions to the next level in the NFL, but his speed alone could eventually make him intriguing as a deep threat in fantasy."

Wade was an undrafted free agent out of Ole Miss and looks to compete for an end-of-the-depth chart type of role. At the moment, the Ravens have 13 receivers listed on the unofficial depth chart, so there's going to be a big rotation throughout the preseason to narrow down the roster. If Wade continues to get open, he could find his way on to the team, but it likely won't make him fantasy relevant this year."

Wester reportedly took well to punt returns during OTAs, and also made a few plays in the passing game that caught the eye of the former athlete. Ismail also noted that Wester \"hasn't looked overwhelmed by anything thrown at him.\" The 23-year-old broke out during his final season with Florida Atlantic in 2023 (108/1,168/8) but took a slight step back upon his transfer to Colorado in 2024. Baltimore's pass-catching corps isn't one that projects to have much vacant playing time, but the rookie seems bound for at least a role on special teams. He's little more than a deep dynasty stash currently."

While David Njoku has the No. 1 TE job locked down in Cleveland, Mitchell-Paden will look to carve out a reserve role in the team's offense once the regular season starts. For now, he is worth consideration in preseason DFS contests in Week 3 of the preseason when the Browns face the Seattle Seahawks."

However, he isn't the best blocker on the planet, which may limit his workload in Baltimore's run-heavy offensive approach. Nonetheless, Kolar probably won't surpass Mark Andrews on the depth chart. Yet, he may get some attention on occasion, primarily since Lamar Jackson will need help on the receiving end after the Ravens dealt Marquise Brown to the Cardinals. Kolar also won't be the most attractive option for fantasy managers, even though he should find the end zone here or there during the 2022-23 campaign, just not enough to take up a consistent spot in any starting lineup."

On Wednesday, Cook went on Instagram Live and specifically said, \"15 mill.\" The former Georgia Bulldog is entering the final season of his rookie deal after rushing for at least 1,000 yards in each of the last two seasons. Cook found the end zone 18 times in 2024. A $15 million salary would put Cook as the second-highest-paid running back in the NFL behind only Christian McCaffrey."

Palmer put up a WR2 performance in Week 9 but has otherwise been outside of the top 24 fantasy wide receivers every week this season. The Ravens secondary struggles mightily against wide receivers (they've allowed the most fantasy points and the most yards to outside pass catchers), but Palmer just isn't involved enough in the passing game to be anything more than a touchdown-dependent dart throw in deep leagues."

In his defense, the Cardinals' offense was anemic and did not call on him for an extra point in the entire game. In other words, fantasy managers should throw Week 12 out the window, as Prater has kicked a solid 19 field goals on the year. The veteran kicker has missed just four kicks all season and remains a decent option, despite the lack of consistency from the Arizona offense. Managers in need of kicking help should consider him for Week 13."

The loss of feeling in his arm contributed to a wobbly pass after he took the hit, and he was seen shaking his hand trying to get feeling back. \"Just hit the funny bone nerve and went to throw the ball and just had no feeling in the hand,\" Allen said. He worked with trainers on the sideline to get heat applied to his arm and went back into the game for the next series.

In the last three games with Winston starting, Moore has 17 receptions (29 targets) for 179 yards and his first touchdown of the season, which came this past week in the loss to the New Orleans Saints.

Gilliam is listed as a fullback, but is some type of fullback/tight end hybrid. He scored two short yardage touchdowns during the second preseason game versus the Chicago Bears. Gilliam also made some key blocks in that game as well. It's unlikely he'll have weekly fantasy value as his role in Buffalo is uncertain. However, he might be able to play some type of hybrid role on the team that could be something worth watching in the final preseason matchup."

The 25-year-old saw increased time during minicamp due to Baylon Spector's injury and made multiple plys, including picking off quarterback Josh Allen. Andreessen saw action in 13 regular-season games (one start) for Buffalo in his rookie season and recorded 26 tackles (12 solo) with one tackle for loss and a QB hit. He saw extended run in Week 17 in a 40-14 win over the New York Jets and led the team with eight tackles."

Wilkerson is buried on the depth chart, but this kind of performance certainly helps his status on the team. Although, the Patriots added plenty of depth at receiver this offseason. It would take an impressive preseason and a few injuries for Wilkerson to have a legitimate role in this offense."

Kincaid has missed the past three games and could be in line to return to action this weekend. Kincaid was able to log three full practice sessions this week, which puts him in a great position to return to action. Before this injury, the 25-year-old has had an underwhelming season, averaging just 8.2 PPR points per game during the first ten weeks of the season. During this span, Kincaid averaged just 35.6 yards per game. If Kincaid cannot suit up, veteran Dawson Knox will continue to operate as the TE1. If he does return, fantasy managers should view him as a low-end TE1 facing the Detroit Lions, who have allowed the fewest PPR points to opposing tight ends this season."

Bosa is sure to be happy to make it back to the field after nearly three weeks off, as he has seen his last few seasons marred by injury. After appearing in just five games in 2022 due to an inguinal groin tear, a sprained foot limited him to nine games in 2023. Throughout his eight-year career, he has played in just three full seasons. However, his presence at practice is an excellent sign for him and the Chargers defense. Los Angeles presents some sneaky upside as a team defense early in the season for fantasy managers looking to stream the position, as they have three favorable matchups over the first three weeks. They'll square up against the Las Vegas Raiders, Carolina Panthers, and Pittsburgh Steelers to open the year, and a healthy Bosa can only help their case."

He's listed at No. 7 on Dane Brugler's to-100 list, so the Packers would have to trade up within the first round to snag him. If Green Bay doesn't go after McMillan, they could wait until later in the draft and take Texas' Matthew Golden, Ohio State's Emeka Egbuka or Missouri's Luther Burden III. Schneidman thinks the Packers go receiver regardless in Round 1, and it would make sense with Christian Watson (knee) expected to miss around half of the 2025 season."

However, it's worth noting that he was out-snapped and out-produced by Ezekiel Elliott during their last game together in Week 6. Presumably, Dowdle will get first dibs on carrying the ball versus Atlanta, but Dallas won't shy away from riding the hot hand, especially if Elliott or Dalvin Cook play well in the opening quarter.

Instead, he's projected to start on the Non-Football Injury list, which will open up a roster spot elsewhere while also buying more recovery time for Hooker. Jared Goff will be the starter, while Nate Sudfeld's growing mastery of the offense helps facilitate stashing Hooker instead of rushing him onto the field at less than 100 percent health. Hooker will be nothing more than a speculative dynasty/keeper-league stash in fantasy leagues in the fall."

Renfrow's four targets are the most he's seen through four games, eclipsing his previous high of two in Week 3. With the big three of Davante Adams, Jakobi Meyers, and Josh Jacobs seeing most of the passing game usage, Renfrow has yet to have a decent fantasy game. Adams has not practiced the past two days and is currently questionable for the game on Monday night. If Adams misses, Renfrow could be in line for increased usage. That said, Renfrow did not step up in the absence of Meyers in Week 2, so it would be unwise to assume he would step up now. The 27-year-old receiver has run 83 routes and only earned a target on 8.4% of those routes. Renfrow should not be rostered by fantasy managers, given his target share and usage through the first four games this season."

As long as the 35-year-old Dalton is healthy this year, he'll be holding a clipboard on the sidelined while helping prepare Young for his first NFL campaign.

The former fifth-rounder finished 2024 with 39 tackles (24 solo) an interception and a forced fumble in 14 games (four starts).

Zavala had to be carted off and will not return to the contest. The 24-year-old will be taken to a local hospital, but the good news is that he gave a thumbs up as he was being carted off the field in Detroit. Hopefully, Zavala is able to avoid a serious injury that would knock him out for an extended period of time. As of right now, he's probably a long shot to be able to play in Week 6 on the road in Miami against the Dolphins on Sunday, Oct. 15."

With Thomas now retired, the team has a position battle for who will emerge as the starter at the position. It is expected to come down to rookie Austin Corbett and veteran Shon Coleman. Browns beat reporter Scott Petrak believes that Corbett will win the job and open the season as the starter at left tackle. Corbett was the No. 33 overall pick in this year's draft, while Petrak believes the coaching staff is not impressed with Coleman at this point. Coleman filled in at the position after Thomas got injured during 2017, so he is expected to get first crack at keeping his job, but he may have a hard time holding off Corbett."

Moton was a second-round selection in 2017 and has played nearly every snap on the team's offensive line -- he missed six snaps in 2019 -- since he entered the league.

The Jets have bigger needs on the defensive line and in the secondary, so it will be interesting to see if they pass on Ekwonu if he's available. Some talent evaluators rate Gardner as the No. 2 prospect in the draft, and the Jets view him as a true lockdown cornerback. The Jets like pass-rushers Kayvon Thibodeaux from Oregon and Jermaine Johnson II from Florida State, but fourth overall is too high for them. Either player would be in consideration at No. 10 overall if the Jets hang onto that pick."

Evans was one of PFF's highest-rated tight ends in the country before the ACL injury that ended his 2023 season.

In 17 regular-season games (10 starts), he had 29 tackles (18 solo), a career-high 6.5 sacks, seven tackles for loss, 11 QB hits, two pass breakups and a forced fumble in his fifth year in the NFL. The 26-year-old pass-rusher entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent out of Missouri S&T and will now head to the NFC South after racking up 114 tackles (56 solo), 13.5 sacks, 14 tackles for loss, 26 QB hits, one interception, four forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries in 72 games (13 starts). The Panthers continue to add to a defense that allowed the most points in the league in 2024."

Johnson finished 2019 with 36 tackles and two interceptions in 13 games played. The Utah product brings a persistent mindset and is known for his tight coverage. The only downside is his tendency be overaggressive at times. With Kyle Fuller and Buster Skrine slated to be the starting corners for Chicago, Johnson will likely be inserted into a backup cornerback role and have to prove himself before he can take a starting role."

While the Lions' defense ranks second in points allowed, they are vulnerable against the pass, ranking 25th in pass yards allowed. Moore will look to build on his momentum from Week 12 when he posted seven receptions for 106 yards and a touchdown in a tough loss to the Minnesota Vikings. His touchdown came on a well-executed screen pass, showcasing his ability to make big plays in space. With the Bears likely playing from behind in this game, Moore should see plenty of targets as the team looks to exploit Detroit's weak pass defense. He's a solid flex play this week with significant upside, particularly in a matchup that could see the Bears forced into a pass-heavy game script."

Swift rushed 13 times for just 30 yards, marking his worst performance in recent memory, though it came against a tough Vikings defense. While the running game was largely ineffective, Swift made his presence felt in the passing game, hauling in three catches for 35 yards. Despite being bottled up on the ground, Swift sparked the offense with a key reception that helped set up a touchdown drive. However, in disappointing news for Swift fantasy managers, the touchdown run went to his backup, Roschon Johnson, who has become the Bears' go-to option in goal-line and short-yardage situations. With a quick turnaround, Swift and the Bears will look to rebound against the NFC-leading Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving Thursday."

If Burden steps in as the primary slot receiver in Johnson's system, he could be set for a huge rookie year as he plays the role that made Amon-Ra St. Brown a star in Detroit. He'll be high-risk until we get a clearer picture of his role, but he has a very high ceiling if he secures enough of the target share in Chicago."

This will be a camp battle worth monitoring, as it was presumed Jahan Dotson had the inside edge in this role. Dotson is listed as the current WR2 on Washington's unofficial depth chart, but Zaccheaus will also have Dyami Brown and rookie Luke McCaffrey to contend with for playing time. He's nothing more than a late-draft dart throw or waiver-wire fodder until the situation is more concrete. Zaccheaus is Yahoo!'s WR145."

He has a way of getting his hands on a lot of footballs. He does know the game of football. It comes relatively not easy, but he does understand concepts easier than some guys do, so it's been a real plus.\" Rookie fifth-round corner Terell Smith has also impressed Hoke during organized team activities this week."

Byard has 64 tackles, five interceptions, a sack, 12 passes defensed, two QB pressures and a forced fumble in 12 games played this season.

Meanwhile, the Falcon will tender restricted free-agent center Ryan Neuzil, who will end up replacing Dalman. It remains to be seen if Dalman will top Creed Humphrey's four-year, $72 million deal, but either way, he's going to do pretty well for himself. In addition to Dalman, Fowler notes that Green Bay Packers impending center Josh Myers should have a strong market in free agency after avoiding what looked like a potential serious injury in the playoffs."

Braxton Jones and Darnell Wright figure to be the Bears' starters at tackle in 2025, but Jones fractured his fibula last season and could be limited in training camp as a result. Trapilo played both left and right tackle in college, so he could be called upon to step in for Jones if needed. Alongside new playcaller Ben Johnson, better offensive line play in Chicago is a reason for optimism around second-year quarterback Caleb Williams."

Both Marquise Brown and Willie Snead have tougher matchups against Jalen Ramsey and Nickell Robey-Coleman, which leaves Boykin with a favorable matchup against Hill. Although Boykin has a five-inch height advantage over Hill, you can't really trust him in season-long leagues as he's failed to record a catch over the last two games. Boykin is, however, a sneaky DFS tournament dart-throw."

Both players were listed as questionable after practicing in a limited capacity on Friday. Berrios will miss his first game of the season after totaling 20 catches for 194 yards and one touchdown through the first nine weeks. Meanwhile, Smythe flashed upside at the start of the season but has come back down to earth, amassing just 168 yards and zero touchdowns on the year. Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle remain the only Miami pass-catchers worth starting in fantasy football."

Loveland played through an AC joint dislocation with the Wolverines last year and finished with 56 catches for 582 yards and five touchdowns in his final year at college. Despite the fact that the 20-year-old won't take part in the Combine this week and is unlikely to do a Pro Day workout, he still has the talent to be selected in the first round in April's NFL draft. For fantasy purposes, although Loveland could eventually develop into a nice pass-catching tight end, nobody will be expecting him to be the next Brock Bowers or Sam LaPorta in 2025."

It's challenging for a tight end to have a productive game when the quarterback completes only ten passes for a total of 131 yards. After some strong performances recently, it was disappointing to see Kmet's lack of production. He was even out-targeted by backup tight end Gerald Everett, who had two targets compared to Kmet's one, which is discouraging for fantasy owners who expected Kmet to dominate the tight end targets. On National Tight End Day, when many tight ends across the league excelled, the Bears unfortunately fell short. Kmet will aim to bounce back next week in a favorable matchup against the weaker Arizona Cardinals defense."

The 22-year-old interior defensive lineman had 22.5 tackles for loss and 10 sacks in 43 games with the Aggies while playing through a leg fracture in his final season. Turner's explosiveness makes up for the fact that he weighs just under 300 pounds. He's also versatile on the defensive line and could be moved around by the Bears in his first season in the NFL. Turner will most likely be a rotational player in his first NFL season, which means he won't be on the IDP fantasy radar at all."

    "text": "The Cincinnati Bengals have claimed defensive back Marco Wilson off waivers on Tuesday. Wilson was waived by the New England Patriots on Monday, so it didn't take long for him to find a new home. Wilson has been a rotational player in New England this season with only 15 tackles in 10 games. The Bengals needed to do something quick with DJ Turner (collarbone) done for the season. That being said, Wilson should have a bigger role with the Bengals than he did with the Pats. Wilson is a former third-round pick of the Arizona Cardinals, but he has seen his role on the field decrease each season. He'll get a chance to prove himself in Cincinnati."

Reporter Jaron May writes that Brooks had three catches -- two checkdowns and one designed route -- in the first set of 11-on-11 drills at training camp practice on Friday. The 23-year-old sixth-round selection wasn't a very prolific pass-catcher in his college days at Texas Tech, but he could be used more as a receiver at the next level as he competes for a depth role going into his first NFL season. Chase Brown is the team's unquestioned lead back, but Brooks will compete with Zack Moss (neck) and Samaje Perine for a change-of-pace role. For now, he's more of a dynasty stash."

Last season, he rushed for 790 yards and 14 touchdowns on just 121 attempts. However, he caught just 12 passes during his entire four-year collegiate career and struggled at the NFL combine, which are likely primary factors in him going unselected during the 2024 NFL Draft.

Knight has the makings of a future leader of the defense in Cincinnati. He lacks size at 6-foot-2, 235 pounds, but he has good speed and was productive as a starter at South Carolina and Charlotte in college. Knight's coverage skills should make him an immediate starter in 2025 for a Bengals defense that was their glaring weakness last year. His athleticism and role as an every-down linebacker should also make him relevant in IDP fantasy leagues sooner than later."

The 29-year-old played in eight games for the Chiefs in 2019, racking up 24 combined tackles and one sack as defensive line depth. Pennel has just two sacks in six seasons in the NFL with the Chiefs, Packers and Jets. Kansas City's depth at nose tackle will be a little thinner to begin the regular season with Pennel suspended."

But the former third-round pick wants to prove he was worth the trade while also being worthy of a long-term deal with the Chiefs. \"I want to be here for a long time, I do,\" Brown said. \"I'm going to make sure I take care of my part, and that's handling my business on the football field.\" There is currently no extension in the works for Brown, and the Chiefs will likely wait until after the year to discuss a new deal. They could also use the franchise tag on Brown, if necessary. A two-time Pro Bowler at right tackle, Brown excelled in the move to left tackle last year in Baltimore. After a disastrous Super Bowl experience for the Chiefs offensive line, Brown is expected to solidify quarterback Patrick Mahomes' blind side."

He's currently competing for the No. 3 receiver role behind Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Such a position on the depth chart was most recently occupied by Tyler Boyd. The Bengals would love to get production out of Burton in his first pro season, and as Breer points out, he could benefit from Chase and Higgins drawing away coverage."

With DK Metcalf (shoulder) and Tyler Lockett (knee) banged up, Fant's return could not have come sooner.

The veteran receiver has been productive in his two games with Jameis Winston under center, posting 12 catches for 152 yards over that span. Jeudy's arrow in fantasy is pointing up with him heading into his bye in Week 10."

    "text": "Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson has struggled for much of the 2024 season, managing to throw for multiple touchdowns in just one of five games thus far. He will look to turn things around in Week 6's road matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles have struggled against opposing quarterbacks this season, allowing the second-most fantasy points per game to the position through four games. The plus matchup gives some optimism for Watson to have a good game, although he failed to capitalize on a similarly good matchup against the Washington Commanders last week, throwing for just 125 yards and one touchdown. The Cleveland offense looks broken with the offensive line banged up, Watson playing poorly, and the receivers struggling with drops, making it very tough to trust the Browns' quarterback in fantasy leagues this week. Treat Watson as a low-end QB2 for Week 6."

Jenkins' play helped act as a catalyst to allow LA to get back into the game when they were down by three touchdowns, and the offense was able to turn the change in possession into a touchdown a few minutes later. Jenkins and the rest of the Chargers Defense played a decent game against Pittsburgh and their third-string quarterback getting his first ever start, but they still struggled to generate any pressure on the quarterback. After a second straight loss, they'll need to step it up over the next few weeks if they want to stop the slide."

Owusu-Koramoah will bring intensity and a high motor to his new club. He finished his senior season for the Fighting Irish with 62 tackles (11 for loss) and three forced fumbles."

The Browns have been linked to various members of the quarterback class for quite a while, and now, they finally pull the trigger in the back half of the third round. Gabriel is the fifth signal-caller off the board, joining Cam Ward, Jaxson Dart, Tyler Shough, and Jalen Milroe. Interestingly, Shedeur Sanders, who was once mentioned as a candidate for Cleveland at No. 2 overall, remains available as many quarterback-needy teams opt for different players. Gabriel played six seasons of college football, with stops at UCF, Oklahoma, and Oregon. Replacing Bo Nix with the Ducks in 2024, Gabriel completed 326 of his 447 pass attempts for 3,857 yards, 30 touchdowns, and six interceptions. He also showcased his mobility with 149 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns. Gabriel will likely compete with Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco while the Browns wait for Deshaun Watson (Achilles) to get healthy."

Judkins is due to report to training camp on Friday alongside the quarterbacks and the rest of the rookies. However, Cabot writes that the Browns have stressed to Judkins that he must \"make his domestic incident the high priority over football.\" If Judkins misses time in camp or during the season due to potential suspension, more playing time would open in the Browns backfield for both incumbent back Jerome Ford and fourth-round rookie Dylan Sampson."

But even though Zappe was unable to put any points on the board in his first start of 2023 in the Week 13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, it looks like he's going to get another chance to lead the offense on a short week. Not only is Zappe a desperation low-end QB2, at best, in two-QB fantasy leagues, but the Patriots' offense is extremely beat up and will be without lead back Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle)."

Finding success in Week 10 could be just as much of an uphill battle, as the Colts take on a tough Buffalo pass defense and Flacco will be down one of his weapons with Michael Pittman Jr. set to miss the game. While Buffalo has been tough on quarterbacks, allowing the sixth-fewest fantasy points to opposing signal-callers, their rush defense has been gashed for the second-most fantasy points to opposing running backs. With former Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Taylor in tow, it's all the more reason to lean on the run game. That leaves Flacco as a low-end QB2 in Week 10."

In addition to Bond, the Packers have taken a look at Stanford pass-catcher Elic Ayomanor. After adding only Mecole Hardman in free agency at the position, Green Bay is primed to address the position in this year's NFL draft, especially with Christian Watson (knee) potentially missing half of the 2025 season. Bond lacks size but could excel as a shifty wide receiver in space in head coach Matt LaFleur's offense, while Ayomanor's skillset makes him more of a downfield threat."

He had 10 carries for 42 yards and a touchdown, along with one catch for 11 yards. The 23-year-old made a strong case for the third backup role in an already crowded backfield with Kimani Vidal, Hassan Haskins, and Nyheim Hines. Sanders, who transferred to South Carolina from Arkansas in his senior year, finished his college career with 881 yards on 183 carries and 11 touchdowns on the ground, plus 27 catches for 316 yards and two touchdowns. With Najee Harris' (eye) Week 1 availability uncertain, the rookie will have to continue to prove himself to secure a spot on the final roster."

Not only did these numbers place him atop the MAC, but they led all of FBS, too. He added 10 touchdowns along the way. Cleveland has David Njoku at tight end, but they're in need of major offensive reinforcements and will still benefit from adding a dominant pass-catcher like Fannin."

The Browns used the No. 33 overall pick on Schwesinger in April with Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah's (neck) football future in question. Schwesinger is big, instinctual and will also contribute on special teams for Cleveland right away. The 22-year-old was only a one-year starter in college at UCL, but he has a high motor and led all FBS linebackers in 2024 with 136 tackles (90 solo). With Owusu-Koramoah not expected to play at all in 2025, Schwesinger should start at weakside linebacker for the Browns and could have some IDP fantasy value sooner than later because of his tackling ability."

Over the past two weeks, Njoku has enjoyed two big performances, averaging an impressive 21.7 PPR points per game during this stretch and scoring three touchdowns. If Njoku cannot turn the corner, fantasy managers should expect Jordan Akins to operate as the TE1 for Cleveland. Akins got a few starting opportunities earlier in the season when Njoku missed time and could be worth a look in deeper 14+ team formats facing the Kansas City Chiefs, who have allowed the second-most PPR points to opposing tight ends this season."

After going undrafted out of Auburn in 2020, Cannella has spent time with five NFL organizations, but he has not appeared in an NFL game. However, he's been a standout performer for the Arlington Renegades of the UFL over the last two seasons, totalling 97 receptions for 971 yards and seven touchdowns in 20 games. The 28-year-old has not found a way to stick on an NFL roster, but he's getting another chance entering the 2025 campaign. It would be a surprise if he makes a fantasy football impact based on what we've seen thus far, especially in a Cleveland tight end room that already has David Njoku and Harold Fannin Jr."

Tryon is extremely versatile and gives the Bucs a hybrid body with a tough side. Tampa is likely hoping that he can take over on the defensive line once Jason Pierre-Paul is done. Tryon opted out of the 2020 season due to COVID-19, but his tape is pretty impressive. He has a great frame and size at the position and could become an immediate contributor for a much-improved Buccaneers defense as they look to defend their Super Bowl crown. There are plenty of questions with Tryon, especially since he took a year off, but he has more than enough talent to threaten NFL offensive tackles."

Graham will do everything else at his school's Pro Day workout. The 21-year-old is just following the trend of the top NFL prospects skipping Combine workouts all together in favor of the more controlled environments at their Pro Day. In his final season with the Wolverines in 2024, Graham was a dominant defensive lineman by racking up 45 tackles (seven for loss) and 3.5 sacks to earn first-team All-American honors. Graham should be an immediate starter in 2025 in his first year in the NFL with whatever team calls his name in the early first round on Day 1."

A decision has not been made on whether to put him on injured reserve, hinting that it's a possibility for the 31-year-old veteran. Quarterback Cooper Rush took over in relief on Sunday and is presumably the starter moving forward, but this is a downgrade for the entire Cowboys offense.

    "text": "Dallas Cowboys safety Markquese Bell (shoulder) will have season-ending shoulder surgery in the near future, according to head coach Mike McCarthy. Bell suffered a dislocated left shoulder covering a kickoff in the second quarter of the Monday night loss to the Houston Texans when trying to tackle running back Dameon Pierce. It's the latest in a long string of injuries to key players for the Cowboys on both sides of the ball in 2024. Defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence (foot) has been on Injured Reserve since Week 4, and cornerback DaRon Bland (foot) has yet to play this year after having foot surgery in August. However, Dallas' defense could get a big boost if Bland is able to make his 2024 debut this Sunday against the division-rival Washington Commanders. Dallas' D/special teams won't be a recommended fantasy play in Week 12."

Blue is expected to have a big role on offense and is very explosive, but it's not a great sign for him heading into training camp. The 21-year-old is also under 200 pounds and comes with ball-security issues from his college days. The Cowboys like Blue's speed and explosiveness, but he didn't work at all with the first-team offense in spring workouts, suggesting Dallas could open the year with a backfield consisting mostly of Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders. The Cowboys will be hoping that Blue can mature quickly, but he's also no lock to make the roster out of training camp."

His fantasy stock is taking another hit with rookie Jonathon Brooks (knee) fully expected to make his NFL debut this weekend against the Chiefs after recovering from an ACL tear that he suffered in 2023 in his final collegiate season at Texas. Brooks will serve as the change-of-pace back behind starter Chuba Hubbard on Sunday and most likely for the rest of the 2024 season, relegating Sanders to the RB3 role whenever he recovers from his ankle injury."

Sanborn became a full-time starter in his first NFL season in Week 9 for the Bears after they traded All-Pro Roquan Smith away, and Sanborn will finish the year with a very respectable 64 tackles (50 solo), five tackles for loss, three QB hits, two sacks and a fumble recovery in 14 games (six starts). The Bears will need someone to step up in Sanborn's absence over the final three regular season games. The 22-year-old Sanborn's solid rookie season will likely earn him a substantial role heading into his second NFL season in 2023."

Many people expected the Cowboys to go with a tight end with their first-round selection, but they pivoted after the Bills traded up in front of them to take Utah's Dalton Kincaid. Smith is a large human at 6-foot-3, 323 pounds, and will bring a physical presence to the interior of Dallas' defensive line in 2023 and beyond. While he's strong, he's also raw, so he'll need to be coached up on his technique if he's to become anything more than a big run-stopper for the Cowboys. Smith also only has two years of starting experience in college, so there is room for improvement."

It's the Chargers second first-rounder, as they took Oregon QB Justin Herbert sixth overall. The Bolts are getting a three-down linebacker who can cause chaos from sideline to sideline. He plays downhill with tremendous physicality and energy, and he's a player that most teams were infatuated with on and off the field in the pre-draft process. The middle of the defense was the Chargers weakness, so Murray should fit in right away to improve that weakness. LA's defense/special teams should be highly coveted by fantasy owners with Murray now in the fold. The Patriots received a second- and third-round pick from the Chargers with this swap."

He plays with great leverage and has great physical traits at 6-foot-8, 322 pounds with 34 1/8-inch arms. There have been injury concerns with the 22-year-old, though, and it remains to be seen if he can develop into a starting-caliber left or right tackle in the NFL. Guyton doesn't have a lot of experience at the tackle position, but he could be competing for Dallas' starting left-tackle job right away in 2024 to replace Tyron Smith."

The 21-year-old may not be great right away in the NFL, but he does have plenty of upside at both tackle and guard, which will give the Cowboys some flexibility. Smith stands at an imposing 6-foot-5, 324 pounds, and he had a 5.02-second 40-yard dash at the combine back in February. It's more likely that Smith is starting at a guard spot in the NFL initially."

Dallas has lost future Hall of Fame offensive linemen Tyron Smith and Zack Martin over the last two offseasons, so the group is in transition heading into the 2025 campaign.

For those in dire need at the TE position in Week 12 with six teams on bye, Dallas' Luke Schoonmaker could be in play as a sleeper against Washington, a defense that allowed 12.7 half-PPR points per game to TEs the last three weeks.

Lamb finished the contest having played a season-low 68 percent of the offensive snaps, spending a good portion of the second half on the sideline without his helmet. It's unclear if Lamb was sidelined due to performance or injury. It's worth noting that he did seem to react to a potential shoulder injury after being taken down by a defender, but the Cowboys never made any sort of injury report announcement regarding Lamb. Regardless of whether he's injured, fantasy managers can be rightfully disappointed about Lamb's quiet showing in a game where other Dallas pass-catchers, such as Brandin Cooks, KaVontae Turpin, and Luke Schoonmaker, thrived. If healthy, Lamb will look to bounce back as a low-end WR1 in fantasy football against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 14."

Turner had an excellent Senior Bowl week by getting after the quarterback, but there are durability concerns. He has plenty of length and ability off the edge while rushing the quarterback, though. Turner has plenty of effort and hustle and chases the football all over the field. He has first-step explosiveness despite having long limbs. The Saints were widely expected to take a cornerback with their first-round pick and were even thought to be interested in trading up in the first round to do so, but they decided to go with a pass-rusher instead. Look for them to address their corner need on Friday."

Winfrey was labeled as immature coming out of Oklahoma for the NFL draft, and he has done nothing to shake those concerns so far with Cleveland. The Browns were already looking for help at the three-technique defensive tackle position, and there's a good chance they'll now move on from Winfrey. The 22-year-old former fourth-round pick last year had 22 tackles (eight solo) and half a sack in 13 games (zero starts) in his rookie season in 2022."

In addition to his 5.5 sacks through nine contests, he has 35 tackles (19 solo), six tackles for loss, 11 QB hits and a pass breakup for a strong Denver defense. Cooper had a career-high 8.5 sacks, career-high 72 tackles (44 solo), an interception and two fumble recoveries (one returned for a TD) in 2023."

    "text": "The Broncos added to their defensive secondary by selecting cornerback Jahdae Barron out of Texas with the No. 20 pick in the NFL Draft. Barron won the 2025 Thorpe Award Winner for the best defensive back in the country after snagging five interceptions and not allowing a touchdown all season. He added 67 tackles, 11 pass deflections, and one sack, showing off versatility that should make him successful at the NFL level. Barron will join Patrick Surtain II to give the Broncos one of the best defensive backfields in the league. Some Broncos fans may be disappointed that the team didn't go with an offensive playmaker, but they added a player who should be a very valuable contributor right away on defense."

Key entered the league as an undrafted free agent out of Western Kentucky, signing with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2021. He'd bounce around to Atlanta before finding his way to the Broncos' practice squad in 2022. The 27-year-old competed for playing time over the next two seasons but finally broke through in 2024 -- logging 17 games with the team. On less than a quarter of Denver's snaps, Key notched 33 tackles (17 solo) with one sack and one tackle for loss. Furthermore, in each instance he was given over 50% of the snaps in a single contest, he recorded at least four takedowns. He's currently slotted second on the team's depth chart behind free agent acquisition Talanoa Hufanga."

Dobbins has missed the required four games while on IR and should return to action this weekend despite being listed as questionable on Thursday's final injury report. He's a top candidate for Comeback Player of the Year in the NFL in 2024 and leads the Chargers with eight touchdowns in his 11 games played for the Bolts. Dobbins has also averaged a solid 4.8 yards per carry on a career-high 158 rushing attempts in 2024. Gus Edwards (ankle) has already been ruled out, which is good news for Dobbins, but LA could still involve both rookie Kimani Vidal and Hassan Haskins if they look to ease Dobbins back into the offense."

Estime also lost a fumble. Lead back Javonte Williams was the real winner on the night for Denver's offense with 14 carries for a season-high 88 yards and his first two touchdowns of the year. Estime's five carries were a season-high after seeing two totes apiece in his first two NFL games in Weeks 1 and 6. Although Estime could be in head coach Sean Payton's doghouse after losing a fumble against New Orleans, the rookie's presence in Denver's backfield moving forward is yet another reason why McLaughlin cannot be trusted in starting fantasy lineups. Neither RB was targeted in the passing game on Thursday."

It doesn't mean the Broncos won't add to the position in free agency, though, and Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Zack Baun and Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton could be targets for the Broncos.

Vaughn is only 5-foot-6, 176 pounds, the shortest player to be measured at the NFL combine. He's been stellar with the fundamentals and has been above-average in the passing game. His routes are crisp and his hands have been a sure thing. Pass protection could be an issue because of his size, but his abilities on special teams also add to his value for a potential roster spot. The sixth-rounder won't be on the fantasy radar for 2023 drafts, but he could provide depth behind Tony Pollard, Malik Davis, Rico Dowdle and Ronald Jones."

They would never look back, with rookie quarterback Bo Nix throwing for over 300 yards and a career-high four touchdowns. Adkins' first touchdown of the year came in the Week 8 win over the Carolina Panthers. The 25-year-old shouldn't be a waiver-wire consideration at all this upcoming week after his second score, as he now has only six receptions for 34 yards and two TDs on seven targets in 11 games in 2024. There's a good chance we won't hear from the second-year TE again."

    "text": "The Denver Broncos selected Wisconsin-Whitewater offensive lineman Quinn Meinerz with the No. 98 overall pick in the third round of the 2021 NFL draft on Friday. It was against lesser competition, but Meinerz manhandled his opponents in college. He has incredible leverage and burst off the line of scrimmage and can play anywhere on the interior up front. He's a great athlete at 6-foot-3, 320 pounds and finishes plays strong. Meinerz can get a bit too aggressive in pass protection at times, but he will give the Broncos some solid depth on the offensive line to help protect Drew Lock/Teddy Bridgewater and running backs Melvin Gordon III and Javonte Williams."

With Greg Dulcich (hamstring) going down with an injury that is going to cost him multiple weeks, Trautman led the Broncos in receiving with five catches for 34 receiving yards on five targets. While he may have been worth a waiver-wire pickup in deeper fantasy leagues for tight end depth this week, he's still nothing more than a low-end streaming option at the position in a Broncos offense that is still trying to find their identity in new head coach Sean Payton's system. The 26-year-old is going to have an expanded pass-catching role in Week 2 against the Washington Commanders this Sunday, but he could also be losing out on targets if receiver Jerry Jeudy (hamstring) makes his season debut."

However, Heinicke also impressed during a playoff start and Allen won't have much fantasy upside as a QB2 if he's the starter."

The second-year defensive back was projected to serve as the primary backup to Terrion Arnold at left cornerback. If Rakestraw is sidelined for an extended period, Rock Ya-Sin could move up the depth chart. Rakestraw's rookie season was limited after a hamstring injury removed him from a scheduled Week 2 start, and he ultimately appeared in eight games on special teams. The severity of Sunday's injury remains unknown, but it's a situation worth monitoring for the Lions defense."

St. Brown has scored in seven straight games, with a consistent 29% target share and 17 fantasy points per game average. While his yardage has been modest, averaging 56 receiving yards over the past seven games, his knack for finding the end zone bolsters his fantasy floor. This week, St. Brown faces a Jaguars defense that ranks last in both EPA and DVOA against the pass and allows the sixth-most fantasy points to wide receivers. Jacksonville's secondary has struggled with big plays, surrendering the most 20+ yard receptions per game. With Detroit's high-powered offense averaging 31.6 points per game, St. Brown's red zone involvement and touchdown potential make him an elite WR1 start."

The 22-year-old is a tough, physical, sideline-to-sideline linebacker that should fit well in head coach Dan Campbell's defense. He has a feel for blocking schemes and plays particularly well in zone schemes in the middle of the defense. Campbell is built to play downhill in the box against opposing run games and plays with above-average field awareness. He turned heads at the scouting combine and was a unanimous All-American in 2022 as one of the nation's top linebackers."

Turner will remain in the NFC West after spending the first six seasons of his NFL career with the Arizona Cardinals after he entered the league in the desert in 2018 as an undrafted free agent out of Washington. The 27-year-old has mostly worked on special teams in his career and has a total of just 83 tackles (45 solo) and a forced fumble in 80 career games played (three starts) with Arizona. Turner will most likely serve in a special teams role again in 2024 in his new digs. He's not at all on the fantasy radar in IDP setups."

Lopez, 27, spent his last two seasons in Arizona, racking up 70 tackles and one sack across 30 games played. The former sixth-round pick notched the second-most snaps of the Cardinals' interior defensive linemen, though he eclipsed 50% of snaps in just five of 16 appearances. Lopez projects to serve primarily as a depth piece for Detroit as they attempt to make the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance in 2025. He'll join a defense that let up the sixth-fewest rushing yards per game in 2024 (103)."

With LaPorta out this weekend, expect both Brock Wright and Shane Zylstra to see the field more in two-TE sets, with Wright being the better target as a TE2 streamer in deeper leagues and DFS. LaPorta's absence should also mean more targets for receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown, Tim Patrick and Kalif Raymond."

Yeboah hauled in four receptions for 100 yards and two touchdowns in what ended up being a tie game. He entered this game with two receptions for six yards in the preseason. Fantasy managers shouldn't get carried away by the stats from this game. Yeboah was facing the third-string Eagles defense. He is buried on the Jets depth chart, but this game might be enough to keep him on the 53-man roster. Regardless, he won't be worth adding in almost any fantasy format."

The 22-year-old was a third-team All-Big Ten selection in 2024 after starting 13 games for the national champions. He recorded 46 tackles (eight for loss) and 2.5 sacks while missing three games due to injury. Williams had impressive tackle production as a run-clogger up the middle thanks to his nimble feet. He has the ability to dominant man-to-man matchups with offensive guards but will need to work on his hands at the next level with the Lions. The former Buckeye probably won't be a big sack guy, at least initially, which makes him a long shot to be worth a look in IDP fantasy formats in 2025."

    "text": "Green Bay Packers wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks comes off his bye week to face a tough Chicago Bears defense on the road on Sunday in Week 11. The Bears secondary has allowed the third-fewest half-PPR points to opposing receivers in 2024, so the Packers passing attack could struggle to move the ball consistently this weekend. Wicks, meanwhile, will hope to contribute something after going catchless on three targets in the Week 9 loss to the division-rival Detroit Lions. He does have four touchdowns on the season, but he has only eclipsed 50 receiving yards in a game once in nine games and not since Sept. 29 against the Minnesota Vikings. The 23-year-old has 16 receptions for 192 total yards and is outside the top-50 wideout in average fantasy points per game. Wicks profiles as a low-upside, touchdown-dependent flex option in deeper fantasy leagues against Chicago."

However, with shaky quarterback play partly to blame, the seventh-round pick hauled in just four passes for 18 yards. After catching three passes for 47 yards last week, Melton has at least shown that he deserves a role in the offense. He continues to compete for a roster spot and is certainly trending in the right direction."

McManus was able to make all four of his extra-point tries and his lone field-goal attempt from 33 yards out on Sunday. The 31-year-old continues to be one of the more reliable kickers in the NFL with a strong leg, although he made only 77.8 percent of a career-high 36 field-goal tries in 2022. Fantasy-wise, the problem with McManus is he just wasn't scoring points with enough regularity, and he finished as the No. 22 kicker in the league in overall fantasy points in one of the lowest-scoring offenses in football. If Russell Wilson and Company can figure things out this offseason with a new head coach in tow, McManus could jump back onto the fantasy radar in 2023."

The CB1 slot is currently open since veteran Nevin Lawson will open up the season serving a two-game suspension, leaving Hobbs and second-year corner Amik Robertson competing for the job. With early praise from Gruden, it is worth keeping an eye on Hobbs to see if he can nail down that starting role."

    "text": "Green Bay Packers rookie second-round linebacker Edgerrin Cooper has a decent shot to work his way onto the first-team defense at linebacker in training camp this summer after what he showed during offseason workouts heading into his first NFL season. Cooper has absorbed new defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley's scheme seamlessly after being taken as the first off-ball linebacker in this year's draft at No. 45 overall. The 6-foot-2, 229-pounder has showed impressive speed this offseason, and his eight sacks in his final season at Texas A&M stood out. Cooper has a clear path to earning the starting middle linebacker spot in Green Bay this year after the departure of De'Vondre Campbell. A duo of Cooper and Quay Walker in the middle of the Packers' defense could be nasty in 2024."

However, with Green Bay up big in the fourth quarter, McDuffie probably won't be back. The same can be said for Alexander, especially if the team hopes to get them both on the field for the Packers' next postseason game, assuming Green Bay keeps the lead."

It's another blow to a 49ers squad whose injuries continue piling up on both sides of the ball. San Francisco was already down tackle Trent Williams (ankle) for the contest despite the team believing he could play. With a premiere matchup against the Buffalo Bills on tap next Sunday night, the 27-year-old could be in danger of missing the contest if he cannot clear the league's concussion protocol in a timely fashion. Banks had appeared in every game for San Francisco this season, registering just under 96% of the team's snaps. His practice participation this week will be telling of his status for Sunday's road tilt."

Williams, who is listed as an offensive guard, stands at 6-foot-4 and 322 pounds. He didn't play much in college until his senior year at Cincinnati, and he represents a developmental offensive-guard prospect for the Packers heading into the 2025 season this fall. Williams has good size but lacks agility, which is why he'll likely stick on the interior."

Without Jenkins protecting his blindside, quarterback Aaron Rodgers could face a long evening of running from former Pro Bowl defensive end Nick Bosa, who has amassed four quarterback hits and three sacks in his first two games. The result could be quicker passes from Rodgers and/or an increased focus on the run game in an effort to minimize the impact of Jenkins' absence. His next chance at suiting up comes Week 4 vs. the Steelers."

He's a freak.\" Neyor signed with the 49ers back in April as an undrafted free agent out of Nebraska, and while his college stats won't blow you away, the 24-year-old's athleticism is enough to do so (99th percentile speed score). It won't be easy to find playing time in a crowded room of viable pass-catchers, but the 6-foot-4 rookie should undoubtedly be on fantasy managers' radars in dynasty leagues."

    "text": "The Green Bay Packers drafted Georgia defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt with the No. 28 overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft on Thursday evening. The Packers had two picks near the end of the first round, but they didn't take a wide receiver. Both of their selections, linebacker Quay Walker and Wyatt, are from Georgia as well. Wyatt stands at 6-foot-3, 304 pounds and is a gap-attacking nose tackle that is big and powerful at the point of attack. The 24-year-old defensive lineman finished his four-year collegiate career with 49 solo tackles (12 for loss), five sacks, three passes defensed, two forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries."
